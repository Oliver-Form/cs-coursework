\section{Problem Context and Computational Justification}

\subsection*{Problem Context}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The project involves the development of \textit{ForcePlay}, a two-dimensional particle physics sandbox that enables users to create, manipulate, and observe point-mass particles governed by defined mechanical rules.
    \item The purpose of the system is to provide an interactive environment in which mechanics principles---including force application, momentum exchange, constant acceleration, and collisions---can be explored through real-time simulation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Nature of the Problem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Particle behaviour in classical mechanics is determined by mathematical relationships involving position, velocity, acceleration, and force.
    \item These relationships form a deterministic system in which the state at time $t + \Delta t$ is fully defined by the state at time $t$ and the governing physical laws.
    \item The simulation must support multiple particles, each with independent and interacting state variables.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Computational Solvability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The governing rules (Newton's laws, kinematic equations, and impulse-based collision response) map directly to algorithmic procedures composed of arithmetic operations on numerical state variables.
    \item Time-stepped numerical integration methods (e.g.\ semi-implicit Euler) provide a structured mechanism for updating particle states at fixed intervals.
    \item Collision detection and response require repeated geometric checks and vector calculations, which are inherently suited to computational execution.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Need for Computation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time simulation requires recalculation of particle states at millisecond-scale intervals, which is infeasible to perform manually with consistent accuracy.
    \item The complexity increases with the number of particles; an analogue or non-programmatic system cannot scale to tens or hundreds of independent, interacting objects.
    \item Dynamic modification of environment parameters---including forces, boundaries, and particle properties---requires continuous recomputation that only a computational system can perform efficiently.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Justification for a Programmatic Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A programmatic implementation ensures deterministic and reproducible behaviour based on clearly defined physical rules.
    \item The simulation can update its visual output dynamically in response to user interaction, supporting exploratory use cases.
    \item Features such as pausing, stepping, resetting, and modifying particle attributes depend on maintaining a precise internal state, which is only practical in software.
    \item Real-time rendering provides immediate feedback, which is not achievable with static or manual tools.
\end{itemize}
